Andika Basic Regular v 1.0
==========================


This file provides detailed information on the Andika family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Andika fonts and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be easily confused with one another. 

A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to get the all of characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.

After receiving many insightful comments on the Design Review fonts, we have refined Andika's final letterforms, with alternate shapes still available for some characters. Andika Basic Regular (italic, bold, and bold italic are yet to come) is here released as the foundation for the Andika font family. 

With the SIL TypeTuner utility (see http://scripts.sil.org/TypeTuner), you can select which alternates to use as Andika's default letterforms.

SIL's "Basic" Roman fonts -- Andika Basic, Gentium Basic, and Gentium  Book Basic -- have a limited character set, supporting only the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation. For a complete list of supported characters see the list at the end of this document.

In particular, these fonts do not support:
   
   Full extended Latin IPA
   Complete support for Central European languages
   Greek
   Cyrillic

A much more complete character set, comparable to Charis SIL and Doulos SIL, will be supported in a future version of Andika. This "Basic" font is intended to provide an Andika with stable letterforms for both default and alternate glyphs. No need to request additional glyphs or characters to be supported in the Basic fonts - such support will become available in the full font in the future.


Features
--------

As an SIL "Basic" font, Andika Basic has:
   OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
   A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
   Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode and the SIL PUA
   Character assignments are updated to conform to Unicode 5.1

Andika Basic supports a subset of the smart font features that the Doulos SIL font supports. Those features are:
   Capital Eng alternates
   Capital N-left-hook alternate
   Capital Q alternate
   Capital Y-hook alternate
   Literacy alternates -- single-story a and g -- as default glyphs
   Lower case j alternate
   Lower case dotless j alternate
   Lower case q alternate
   Lower case y-hook alternate
   Modifier apostrophe alternate
   Modifier colon alternate
   No-tail t and y alternates
   Numeral 0 1 4 6 7 9 alternates
   Open O -- both upper and lower case -- alternates
   Tail i and l alternates
   Vietnamese-style diacritics

More detail on features can be seen at http://scripts.sil.org/SILUnicodeRF_Features and http://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSIL_Technical.
