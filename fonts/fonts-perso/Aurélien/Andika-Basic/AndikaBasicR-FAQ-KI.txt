Andika Basic Regular v 1.0
==========================

Where does the name "Andika" come from?

   Andika -- pronounced ahn-DEE-kah
   Swahili -- spoken widely in southeastern regions of the African continent,
       among other places. (See http://www.ethnologue.com/)
   Meaning - "Write!"

What characters are included in this release?

   Andika Basic covers some 630 commonly-used (in the SIL world) Roman
   characters. See http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_technical for the full listing.

Why is the line spacing so much looser than other fonts?

   Our SIL Unicode Roman fonts include characters with multiple stacked
   diacritics that need a much looser line spacing (for example, U+1EA8 LATIN
   CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND HOOK ABOVE). We cannot make the line
   spacing tighter without experiencing “clipping” of those characters. You may
   be able to overcome this by adjusting the line spacing in the application.
   For example, in Microsoft Word select Format / Paragraph and set the line
   spacing to use the Exactly setting and a value more suited to your needs.
   For example, if the font size is 12 pt, select line spacing of Exactly 13 pt.
   This will give a tighter line spacing. You can adjust the value up or down
   depending on how many diacritics you need to stack. Another solution would
   be to use SIL’s TypeTuner utility, which allows choosing a line spacing
   setting as well as choosing default glyphs.

Does this font have straight quotes as well as curly ones?

   Yes, there are both. Here are the Unicode codepoints (in order) and their
   character names included in this font:
   
       U+0022   QUOTATION MARK
       U+0027   APOSTROPHE
       U+2018   LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
       U+2019   RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
       U+201C   LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
       U+201D   RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK

Can I use Andika in my print publication?

   Andika Basic is released under the SIL Open Font License
   (see http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), which permits use for any publication,
   whether electronic or printed. For more answers to usage questions, see the
   OFL-FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ). The license, along with
   information specific to Andika Basic, is in the release package.

Can I use Andika on my website?

   Yes. You can create web pages that request that Andika Basic be used to
   display them (if that font is available on the user’s system). According to
   the license, you are even allowed to place the font on your site for people
   to download it. We would strongly recommend, however, that you direct users
   to our site -- http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download — to download the
   font. This ensures that they are always using the most recent version with
   bug fixes, etc.

Can I make changes to Andika?

   Yes! That is allowed as long as you abide by the conditions of the SIL Open 
   Font License (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). We would be very interested in
   seeing any changes you might make. See "Notes to contributors"
   (http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download) for more information.

Known Issues

   We know of the following problems. Please report any others you encounter:
   
   There has been no manual hinting done, but we have improved the overall
   autohinting parameters. Still, onscreen display may at times be somewhat
   distorted. Please evaluate the letterforms from printed text, but let us
   know if you find severe distortions. In any case, the fonts should look
   fine when printed.
   
   Opening the font with FontLab 5.0.x, then closing it, crashes FontLab.
   We are working to get this bug fixed in the next version of FontLab.
   A workaround is to open the font, save as a .vfb file, close (which
   still causes a crash). Then restart FontLab and open the .vfb file.
   
   There are no alternate versions of fi and fl ligatures at this time.
